# Audio-Visualizer
Takes WAV file and generates visualization as MP4
You can customize color gradient, number of sound bars, inspect audio file's frequency & volume graphs with pyFFTW & PyQT Graph


### Cons (These could be optimized)
* Becomes very RAM intensive, if audio files are longer than 2 minutes.
* Requires some relatively hard-to-install modules
